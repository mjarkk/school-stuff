# What is this folder?
This folder has all the static files and other things that are not directly relevant to the PHP assignment or do need to be used multiple times.

## Stylus files to css:
- Open a terminal in the `school-stuff/php` folder
- to install type: `npm i` and `npm i -g gulp-cli` (only need to do this 1 time)
- to use type: `gulp`
